# interview-java-pretest
Simple project that confirms whether or not a candidate IDE is sufficient for our Talentful Java code tests.

If you are able to run the Main class within this project and see output `{"key2":"value2","key1":"value1"}` then congratulations! Your IDE will work for our code tests.

If you are having issues with your IDE of choice a VS Code [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) definition is also included for your convenience.  With this file you should be able to run a containerized instance of VS Code that will install all of the required dependencies.
